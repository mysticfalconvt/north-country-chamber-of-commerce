## Email Services

**Domain Email (director@vtnorthcountry.org):**
- Domain email configuration is outside the scope of this website development
- You will need to work with your domain registrar or email hosting provider to:
  - Transfer or configure the director@vtnorthcountry.org domain
  - Create new email addresses as needed
- I can provide guidance on setup, but actual email hosting/configuration is separate

**Website Email (automated notifications):**
- Transactional emails (membership confirmations, event submissions, etc.) will be sent from the website
- This requires an email service provider account (Resend recommended - free tier available)
